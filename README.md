Available to install soon.

This theme is a continuation of [this](https://userstyles.org/styles/144028/google-clean-dark)
(by [Seishiin](https://userstyles.org/users/352024)) userstyle (which hasn't seen any update for over a year now) with improvments made by me as needed.


## Contributing

This repo is always accepting pull requests, but please follow some guidelines:
 - Modify the relevant file:
   - Don't modify [google-clean-darkx.user.css](/google-clean-darkx.user.css), that's the built file. Instead, modify the appropriate file in [./css](/css)
 - There is no need to run [/build.py](/build.py) before submitting a PR
 - Please include a short description of the results of the change, as well as a before/after screenshot

## Future Potential Improvements
In order of descending importance. When I have the time + feel like it
 - Use CSS Color variables
 - Merge in better looking google search styles
 - Autodeploy to userstyles
